A cybersecurity task focused on detecting unsafe browser extensions and enhancing browser safety.

# Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 📘 Objective
To identify, review, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions that could pose security or privacy risks

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Google Chrome Browser  
- Chrome Web Store  
- Online Research on Extension Permissions and Reviews  

## 🪜 Steps Performed
1. Opened the browser and navigated to `chrome://extensions/` to view all installed extensions.  
2. Collected details such as name, permissions, user reviews, and source for each extension.  
3. Analyzed their trustworthiness based on permissions and installation source.  
4. Identified **“AnyDoc Translator”** as a suspicious extension due to third-party installation and unsafe permissions.  
5. Removed the suspicious extension and verified the rest from the official Chrome Web Store.  
6. Restarted the browser and observed performance improvements.  
7. Researched how malicious extensions can harm users through data theft, tracking, and browser hijacking.

## 🔍 Assessment and Reason

- **Add to Google Classroom – Safe:**  
  Official Google extension from Chrome Web Store. Minimal permissions; safe to keep.

- **AnyDoc Translator – Suspicious (Removed):**  
  Added by a third party with risky permissions like clipboard modification and browsing history access. Removed to prevent data leaks.

- **Grammarly: AI Writing Assistant – Safe:**  
  Verified from Chrome Web Store; requires standard permissions for writing assistance. Trusted and secure.

- **McAfee Web Advisor – Medium Risk (Verify Source):**  
  Genuine McAfee product but installed via third party. Needs source verification before keeping active.

- **QuillBot: AI Writing and Grammar Tool – Safe:**  
  Trusted Chrome Web Store extension. Permissions are appropriate for grammar and writing support.

- **Wappalyzer – Medium Risk (Keep if Needed):**  
  Developer tool requesting full website data access. Should be retained only if used regularly.


## ⚙️ Findings
- **AnyDoc Translator** was identified as suspicious and removed.  
- Verified all other extensions from trusted sources.  
- **Browser performance improved** — faster loading and smoother response.  
- Learned how permission overreach can create security risks.

## ✅ Outcome
The task improved my awareness of browser security and data privacy.  
By auditing and removing unsafe extensions, I ensured a cleaner, faster, and more secure browsing environment.  
I also learned how to evaluate permissions, verify developers, and understand how malicious extensions can harm users.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Always install extensions only from verified sources like the Chrome Web Store.  
- Regularly review permissions and remove unused or suspicious add-ons.  
- Extensions can collect sensitive data — constant vigilance is necessary.  
- Browser performance and security improve significantly after cleanup.
